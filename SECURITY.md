## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Vulnerability Reporting

**IMPORTANT**: Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by:

#### Preferred Reporting Methods
1. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the "Security" > "Report a vulnerability" feature on the GitHub repository
2. **Email**: Send email to tracepost.pro@gmail.com with detailed information

#### Required Information
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Potential impact and severity
- Proof of concept (if available)
- Suggested solution (if available)

### Processing Workflow

1. **Acknowledgment (24-48 hours)**: We will confirm receipt of the report
2. **Assessment (3-5 days)**: Analyze and assess severity level
3. **Fix (1-2 weeks)**: Develop and test patch
4. **Disclosure (after fix)**: Public disclosure after patch is available

### Responsible Disclosure Timeline

- **90 days**: Maximum time to fix critical vulnerabilities
- **180 days**: Maximum time for less severe vulnerabilities
- **Coordinated disclosure**: Prior notification before public disclosure

## Security Measures

### Smart Contract Security

#### Auditing
- Smart contracts are audited by third-party security firms
- Regular security reviews for major updates
- Bug bounty program for vulnerability discovery

#### Best Practices
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts when possible
- Implement proper access controls
- Reentrancy protection
- Integer overflow/underflow protection
- Gas limit considerations

#### Testing
- Comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests with realistic scenarios
- Formal verification for critical functions
- Mainnet fork testing

### Backend Security

#### API Security
- Rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- HTTPS only
- CORS configuration

#### Database Security
- Encrypted connections
- Regular encrypted backups
- Access controls
- SQL injection prevention

#### Infrastructure
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting
- WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- DDoS protection

### Frontend Security

#### Client-side Protection
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure cookie configuration

#### Wallet Integration
- Hardware wallet support
- Secure key management practices
- Transaction signing best practices
- Phishing protection

## Vulnerability Classes

### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Smart contracts exploitable to steal funds
- Authentication bypass
- Remote code execution

### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Data breach possibilities
- Privilege escalation
- Significant financial impact

### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Logic errors

### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor information leaks
- Configuration issues
- Non-security impacting bugs

## Bug Bounty Program

### Scope
- Smart contracts on mainnet
- API endpoints
- Frontend application
- Infrastructure components

### Rewards
- **Critical**: $5,000 - $50,000
- **High**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Medium**: $500 - $1,000
- **Low**: $100 - $500

### Rules
- First come, first served
- Only original discoveries
- No social engineering
- No DDoS attacks
- Must follow responsible disclosure

## Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Email**: tracepost.pro@gmail.com
- **PGP Key**: [Public key fingerprint]
- **Response time**: 24-48 hours

### Emergency Contact
For critical security issues:
- **Phone**: +[emergency-number]
- **Signal**: [secure-contact]

## Security Updates

### Notification Channels
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Project website security page
- Email notifications for registered users
- Discord/Telegram announcements

### Update Process
1. Security patch development
2. Testing on testnet
3. Community notification
4. Mainnet deployment
5. Post-deployment verification
