## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to abide by these rules.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs
- Check if the bug has already been reported
- Use the bug report template when available
- Provide detailed information: environment, reproduction steps, expected results

### Suggesting New Features
- Create a GitHub Issue with the "enhancement" label
- Clearly describe the feature and why it's needed
- Discuss with maintainers before implementing

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `develop`
3. Implement changes
4. Write/update tests
5. Ensure coding standards are met
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Setup Development Environment

#### Backend (Node.js/Express)
```bash
cd back-end
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Configure database and blockchain settings
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend (React)
```bash
cd front-end
npm install
npm start
```

#### Docker Development
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Component composition over inheritance
- Prop validation with PropTypes or TypeScript

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- Follow Solidity style guide
- Comprehensive testing
- Gas optimization
- Security best practices
- Documentation with NatSpec

### Database
- Use proper indexing
- Follow normalization rules
- Write efficient queries
- Database migrations

## Testing Guidelines

### Required Tests
- Unit tests: minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Smart contract tests with Hardhat/Truffle
- E2E tests for critical paths

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
cd back-end
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Frontend tests
cd front-end
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Smart contract tests
cd blockchain
npm test
```
