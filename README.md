### Additional Notes

#### Backend Configuration

- Ensure the `.env` file is properly configured with the following variables:

  - `DB_HOST`: Hostname of the PostgreSQL server.
  - `DB_PORT`: Port number for the database.
  - `DB_USER`: Username for the database.
  - `DB_PASSWORD`: Password for the database.
  - `DB_NAME`: Name of the database.

- IPFS integration requires an active IPFS node. Update the `.env` file with:
  - `IPFS_API_URL`: URL of the IPFS API endpoint.
  - `IPFS_API_KEY`: API key for accessing IPFS (if applicable).

#### Frontend Configuration

- For the web application, ensure the `next.config.ts` file is properly set up for API endpoints:

  - `API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for the backend API.

- For the mobile application, update the `app.json` file with:
  - `expo.android.package`: Android package name.
  - `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier`: iOS bundle identifier.

#### Docker Setup

- Use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the root directory to start both backend and frontend services:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

- Verify the services are running:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
